## About the Project

This repository holds the information from my final bachelor's project (PIC) in collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation Neural Dynamics Lab and Instituto Superio Técnico. This project analysed how we can use machine learning algorithms to decode arm movement from neuron activity (spikes). For it, we used the dataset from the [Neural Latents Benchmark](https://neurallatents.github.io/datasets) called MC_Maze.

The folder "Plots" has figures generated using the code in the Jupyter Notebook "Draft Code". The Report is present in this [file](./Report.pdf).

## Getting Started

To be able to run any code you will need to obtain the dataset from [Neural Latent Benchmark (NLB)](https://neurallatents.github.io/datasets). There you should pick the ones from MC_Maze. The reported results are all from the standard dataset (the most complete). Place the dandi folder in a "dataset" folder.

The project deliverables were just the report. Due to this only me and god can understand what was written in the notebook. For any questions, feel free to contact me.
