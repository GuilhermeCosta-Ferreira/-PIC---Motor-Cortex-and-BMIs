This repository holds the information from my final bachelor's project (PIC) in collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation Neural Dynamics Lab and Instituto Superio TÃ©cnico.

This project analysed how we can use machine learning algorithms to decode arm movement from neuron activity (spikes). For it, we used the dataset from the Neural Latents Benchmark (https://neurallatents.github.io/datasets) called MC_Maze.

The folder "Plots" has figures generated using the code in the Jupyter Notebook "Draft Code". I will add a curated code that best describes what I used for the final report. The latter is also present under the same "Report".
